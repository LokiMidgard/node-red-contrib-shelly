This package contains nodes for controlling shelly devices

# Warning
This package is under construction. Right now only the switches like 
- shelly switch 1 (PM), 2 
- shelly plug
- shelly 2.5 (roller shutter) 
- shelly dimmer
- shelly uni
are supported.
Other may work but are not really tested so far.

# Shelly Switch Node
The node is able to turn on and turn off a shelly switch. It outputs the status of all relays after every interaction with the shelly device.
Turning on is done by sending the following payload into the input. The relay number is optional and defaults to 0.


```
{
    relay : 0,
	on : true
}
```

or you can make use of the alternative notation:


```
{
    relay : 0,
	turn : "toggle"
}
```
turn can be one of the following: "toggle", "on", "off"

Right after having sent the request to the shelly device a status request is done. The relays property of the response is output on output 1.

If you only want to get the current status of the switch without turning on or off you should leave the msg.payload blank.
This is useful, when you want to poll for the status cyclically.

The output of the node is an array of status objects for every relay of the switch:


```
[
    {
        ison : true,
	    ...
    },
    {
        ison : true,
	    ...
    },
]
```


# Shelly Door Node
The node is able to poll a shelly door sensor. It outputs the sensor status together with battery and lux sensor values on every change of the door status.
Note that the sensor sleeps when nothing is detected and is thus not accessible via REST.

The output of the node is as follows:


```
{
    sensor
	{
		state: "close",
		is_valid: true
	},

	lux
	{
		value: 150,
		illumination: "twilight",
		is_valid: true
	},

	bat
	{
		value: 100,
		voltage: 6.01
	}
}
```

# Shelly Roller Shutter Node

A node that controls a shelly roller shutter device (Shelly 2.5).
The relay number is optional and defaults to 0. The following object for open or close the roller shutter:

```
{
    roller : 0,
	go : "open"
}
```

```
{
    roller : 0,
	go : "close"
}
```

```
{
    roller : 0,
	go : "to_pos",
	roller_pos: 50
}
```

Right after having sent the request to the shelly device a status request is done. The roller property of the response is output on output 1.

If you only want to get the current status of the switch without turning on or off you should leave the msg.payload blank.
This is useful, when you want to poll for the status cyclically.

The output of the node is an array of status objects for every roller of the roller shutter:

```
[
    {
        state : "open",
	    ...
    }
]
```

```
[
    {
        state : "close",
	    ...
    }
]
```

```
[
    {
        state : "open",
        current_pos: 50,
	    ...
    }
]
```

# Shelly Dimmer (SL) Node
The node is able to turn on and turn off a shelly dimmer and set its brightness. It outputs the status of all lights after every interaction with the shelly device.
Turning on is done by sending the following payload into the input. The light number is optional and defaults to 0. The brightness can be set between 0 and 100.


```
{
    light : 0,
    on : true,
    brightness: 100
}
```

Like in the switch node you can replace on with turn and choose a value from the following: "toggle", "on", "off"

You can also control the shelly state and brightness independently.

```
{
on: true
}
```

and

```
{
brightness: 100
}
```

Right after having sent the request to the shelly device a status request is done. The relays property of the response is output on output 1.

If you only want to get the current status of the dimmer without turning on or off you should leave the msg.payload blank. This is useful, when you want to poll for the status cyclically.

The output of the node is an array of status objects for every light of the dimmer:


```
[
    {
        ison : true,
	    ...
    },
    {
        ison : true,
	    ...
    },
]
```
