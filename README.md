This package contains nodes for controlling shelly devices

# Warning
This package is under construction. Right now the following devices are supported
- shelly switch 1 (PM), 2 
- shelly plug
- shelly 2.5 (roller shutter) 
- shelly dimmer
- shelly uni
- shelly RGBW2

Others may work but are not really tested so far.

# Changelog
Changes can be followed [here](/CHANGELOG.md)


# General
To check if the node is available in the network, a HTTP GET to /shelly is issued. This route returns a type string which is 
verified. You can configure an interval for the polling. The default is 5000ms. Most node will call HTTP GET to the /status route
after a input is received from the node. This answer is directly available at the output via msg.status. The msg.payload property 
contains a lightweight version of this status object.


# Shelly Switch Node
The node is able to turn on and turn off a shelly switch. It outputs the status of all relays after every interaction with the shelly device.
Turning on is done by sending the following payload into the input. The relay number is optional and defaults to 0.


```
{
    relay : 0,
	on : true
}
```

or you can make use of the alternative notation:


```
{
    relay : 0,
	turn : "toggle"
}
```
turn can be one of the following: "toggle", "on", "off"

Right after having sent the request to the shelly device a status request is done. The relays property of the response is output on output 1.

If you only want to get the current status of the switch without turning on or off you should leave the msg.payload blank.
This is useful, when you want to poll for the status cyclically.

The output of the node is an array of status objects for every relay of the switch:


```
[
    {
        ison : true,
	    ...
    },
    {
        ison : true,
	    ...
    },
]
```


# Shelly Door Node
The node is able to poll a shelly door sensor. It outputs the sensor status together with battery and lux sensor values on every change of the door status.
Note that the sensor sleeps when nothing is detected and is thus not accessible via REST.

The output of the node is as follows:


```
{
    sensor
	{
		state: "close",
		is_valid: true
	},

	lux
	{
		value: 150,
		illumination: "twilight",
		is_valid: true
	},

	bat
	{
		value: 100,
		voltage: 6.01
	}
}
```

# Shelly Roller Shutter Node

A node that controls a shelly roller shutter device (Shelly 2.5).
The relay number is optional and defaults to 0. The following object for open or close the roller shutter:

```
{
    roller : 0,
	go : "open"
}
```

```
{
    roller : 0,
	go : "close"
}
```

```
{
    roller : 0,
	go : "to_pos",
	roller_pos: 50
}
```

Right after having sent the request to the shelly device a status request is done. The roller property of the response is output on output 1.

If you only want to get the current status of the switch without turning on or off you should leave the msg.payload blank.
This is useful, when you want to poll for the status cyclically.

The output of the node is an array of status objects for every roller of the roller shutter:

```
[
    {
        state : "open",
	    ...
    }
]
```

```
[
    {
        state : "close",
	    ...
    }
]
```

```
[
    {
        state : "open",
        current_pos: 50,
	    ...
    }
]
```

# Shelly Dimmer (SL) Node
The node is able to turn on and turn off a shelly dimmer and set its brightness. It outputs the status of all lights after every interaction with the shelly device.
Turning on is done by sending the following payload into the input. The light number is optional and defaults to 0. The brightness can be set between 0 and 100.


```
{
    light : 0,
    on : true,
    brightness: 100
}
```

Like in the switch node you can replace on with turn and choose a value from the following: "toggle", "on", "off"

You can also control the shelly state and brightness independently.

```
{
on: true
}
```

and

```
{
brightness: 100
}
```

Right after having sent the request to the shelly device a status request is done. The relays property of the response is output on output 1.  
This feature can optionally be disabled by unticking the `status` checkbox in the node configuration options.

If you only want to get the current status of the dimmer without turning on or off you should leave the msg.payload blank. This is useful, when you want to poll for the status cyclically.

The output of the node is an array of status objects for every light of the dimmer:


```
[
    {
        ison : true,
		brightness: 100
	    ...
    },
    {
        ison : true,
		brightness: 100
	    ...
    },
]
```



# Shelly RGBW2 Node
The node is able to control a RGBW LED light strip. 

If you only want to get the current status of the dimmer without turning on or off you should leave the msg.payload blank. This is useful, when you want to poll for the status cyclically.

The node accepts the following input


```
{
    red : 0,
    green : 0,
	blue : 0,
	white : 0,
	gain : 0,
	effect : 1,
	on : true
}
```

red, green, blue, white can be between 0 and 255. 
gain can be a value between 0 and 100
effect = 0 means no effect.
